untitled budget app is a full stack web app that replaces my clunky google sheets tracking

it was built with [sveltekit](https://svelte.dev/) and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### dev rules:
- could not use AI to assist.
- have to use a new tech stack.
- has to actually be full stack. no "JSON" database...

### to use the app for yourself

1. clone the repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`
